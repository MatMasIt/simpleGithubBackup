Simple bash script to back up all of your github repositories.

Just change the `USER` variable

You may set it as a cronjob


You may need to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

For Debian and derivates, `sudo apt install jq` should suffice

If `jq` is not installed, `url: (23) Failed writing body` error is likely to occur
